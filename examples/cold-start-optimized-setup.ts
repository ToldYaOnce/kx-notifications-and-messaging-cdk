/**
 * üìä COLD START OPTIMIZATIONS EXPLAINED:
 * 
 * 1. **Runtime Upgrade**: NodeJS 20.x has faster startup than 18.x
 * 
 * 2. **Memory Increase**: 1024MB vs 512MB
 *    - More CPU allocated (proportional to memory)
 *    - Faster initialization and execution
 *    - Cost increase: ~$0.50/month for typical usage
 * 
 * 3. **Timeout Increase**: 60s vs 30s
 *    - Handles cold start delays gracefully
 *    - Prevents timeout failures on first event
 * 
 * 4. **Reserved Concurrency**: Limits to 5 concurrent executions
 *    - Prevents Lambda from scaling to cold instances under load
 *    - Keeps instances warm longer
 * 
 * 5. **EventBridge Retries**: 3 attempts with 1hr max age
 *    - If cold start causes timeout, EventBridge retries
 *    - Second attempt usually hits warm instance
 * 
 * 6. **Connection Reuse**: AWS_NODEJS_CONNECTION_REUSE_ENABLED=1
 *    - Reuses HTTP connections between invocations
 *    - Faster DynamoDB operations on warm starts
 * 
 * 7. **Bundle Optimizations**: Minified, modern target
 *    - Smaller bundle = faster download and initialization
 *    - ES2022 target uses modern JS features
 * 
 * 8. **Subscription Caching**: Parse once, cache for warm starts
 *    - Cold start: Parse subscriptions from JSON + eval functions
 *    - Warm start: Use cached parsed subscriptions
 * 
 * 9. **Client Initialization**: DynamoDB client created outside handler
 *    - Reused across warm invocations
 *    - Configured with retries and timeouts

/**
 * üîç MONITORING COLD STARTS:
 * 
 * Check CloudWatch Logs for these patterns:
 * 
 * COLD START (First Event):
 * ‚úÖ "üî• Parsing subscriptions (cold start)"
 * ‚úÖ "üîß Deserialized function for clientId: ..."
 * ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Subscriptions cached for future invocations"
 * 
 * WARM START (Subsequent Events):
 * ‚úÖ "‚ö° Using cached subscriptions (warm start)"
 * ‚úÖ "üìù Creating notification: ..." (much faster)
 * 
 * If you see repeated cold start messages, consider:
 * - Enabling provisioned concurrency
 * - Increasing reserved concurrency
 * - Adding a CloudWatch Event to ping the function every 5 minutes

/**
 * üö® TROUBLESHOOTING COLD START ISSUES:
 * 
 * SYMPTOM: First event never creates notification
 * CAUSE: Cold start timeout (30s default too short)
 * SOLUTION: ‚úÖ Timeout increased to 60s
 * 
 * SYMPTOM: First event creates notification, but very slowly
 * CAUSE: Cold start initialization time
 * SOLUTION: ‚úÖ Memory increased to 1024MB, caching added
 * 
 * SYMPTOM: Every event seems like cold start
 * CAUSE: High concurrency creating new instances
 * SOLUTION: ‚úÖ Reserved concurrency limits scaling
 * 
 * SYMPTOM: Events lost during cold starts
 * CAUSE: EventBridge not retrying failed invocations
 * SOLUTION: ‚úÖ Retry configuration added (3 attempts, 1hr max age)
